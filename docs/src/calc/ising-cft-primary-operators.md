# Ising CFT: Primary Operators and Scaling Dimensions

## Main result

The 2D classical Ising model at the self-dual critical point
$\sinh(2\beta_c J) = 1$ is described at long distances by the
simplest non-trivial unitary conformal field theory — the
**Virasoro minimal model $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$** of central charge
$c = 1/2$. This CFT contains exactly **three** primary operators,
whose left-moving conformal weights $h$ (equal to the right-moving
$\bar h$ since the theory is diagonal) and full scaling dimensions
$\Delta = h + \bar h = 2h$ are

$$\boxed{\;
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
\text{Operator} & h = \bar h & \Delta & \text{Lattice correspondence}\\ \hline
\mathbb{I} \text{ (identity)} & 0 & 0 & \text{1} \\
\sigma \text{ (spin)} & 1/16 & 1/8 & \lim_{a\to 0}\, \sigma^{z}(a\,r) \\
\varepsilon \text{ (energy)} & 1/2 & 1 & \lim_{a\to 0}\,\sigma^{z}_{i}\sigma^{z}_{i+1} - \langle \sigma^{z}\sigma^{z}\rangle_{c}\\
\end{array}
\;}$$

The three scaling dimensions $(0, 1/8, 1)$ are the microscopic
origin of *every* 2D Ising critical exponent (via standard CFT
scaling relations):

$$\boxed{\;\eta = 2\Delta_{\sigma} = \tfrac{1}{4},\qquad
         \nu = \tfrac{1}{d - \Delta_{\varepsilon}} = 1,\qquad
         \beta = \nu\,\Delta_{\sigma} = \tfrac{1}{8},\qquad
         \alpha = 2 - \nu\,d = 0\;(\log),\qquad
         \delta = \tfrac{d + 2 - \eta}{d - 2 + \eta} = 15.\;}$$

In particular $\beta = 1/8$ is exactly the Yang-magnetisation
exponent derived independently from the Toeplitz determinant in
[`yang-magnetization-toeplitz`](yang-magnetization-toeplitz.md), and
the $\eta = 1/4$ correlation-function exponent matches
$2\Delta_{\sigma}$ via Fisher's scaling relation.

The $(\sigma, \varepsilon)$ pair of non-trivial primaries is
responsible for the two distinct massive integrable perturbations
of the Ising CFT:

- $\varepsilon$ perturbation → free massive Majorana fermion
  (thermal perturbation, $T \ne T_{c}$);
- $\sigma$ perturbation → interacting integrable QFT with $E_{8}$
  mass spectrum (magnetic perturbation, see
  [`e8-mass-spectrum-derivation`](e8-mass-spectrum-derivation.md)
  and [`ising-cft-magnetic-perturbation`](ising-cft-magnetic-perturbation.md)).

## Setup

### Virasoro algebra

A 2D CFT with a unique vacuum is characterised by two copies of
the Virasoro algebra (holomorphic + antiholomorphic),

$$[L_{m}, L_{n}]
 \;=\; (m - n)\,L_{m + n} \;+\; \frac{c}{12}\,m(m^{2} - 1)\,\delta_{m + n, 0},$$

with the same relation for $\bar L_{n}$ and $[L_{m}, \bar L_{n}]
= 0$. The central charge $c$ parametrises the anomaly in the
trace of the stress tensor under conformal rescalings; for the 2D
Ising model $c = 1/2$ as we confirm in Step 4.

**Primary operators** are operators $\phi(z, \bar z)$ on which
$L_{n}$ and $\bar L_{n}$ for $n > 0$ annihilate the state
$|\phi\rangle = \phi(0)|0\rangle$:

$$L_{n}|\phi\rangle = 0,\qquad \bar L_{n}|\phi\rangle = 0\qquad
 (n > 0),$$

and $L_{0}|\phi\rangle = h\,|\phi\rangle$, $\bar L_{0}|\phi\rangle =
\bar h\,|\phi\rangle$. The eigenvalues $(h, \bar h)$ are the
**conformal weights**; the scaling dimension is $\Delta = h + \bar h$
and the spin is $s = h - \bar h$. All scaling operators in a CFT
are either primaries or *descendants* (acted on by $L_{-n}$ with
$n > 0$).

### Minimal models

BPZ 1984 proved that unitary CFTs with $c < 1$ are **discrete**:
the only allowed values of the central charge are

$$c_{p, p'} \;=\; 1 \;-\; \frac{6\,(p' - p)^{2}}{p\,p'},
\qquad p, p' \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2},\ \gcd(p, p') = 1,
\tag{1}$$

with the pair $(p, p')$ labelling the model
$\mathcal{M}(p, p')$. Each $\mathcal{M}(p, p')$ has **finitely
many** primary operators, listed by the **Kac table** (Step 3).

### Goal

Derive:
1. $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$ has central charge $c = 1/2$.
2. The Kac table of $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$ has exactly three
   inequivalent primary operators.
3. Their conformal weights are $h \in \{0, 1/16, 1/2\}$.
4. They identify with $\{\mathbb{I}, \sigma, \varepsilon\}$ of the
   lattice Ising model, reproducing the known critical exponents.

## Calculation

### Step 1 — Kac formula for conformal weights

For any minimal model $\mathcal{M}(p, p')$, the conformal weights
of primary operators are given by the Kac formula

$$\boxed{\;
h_{r, s} \;=\; \frac{(p'\,r - p\,s)^{2} - (p' - p)^{2}}{4\,p\,p'},
\qquad 1 \le r \le p - 1,\ \ 1 \le s \le p' - 1.
\;}
\tag{2}$$

This is the statement that a primary labelled by $(r, s)$ has a
null descendant at level $r\,s$ in its Verma module, which
constrains its four-point correlator to satisfy a linear ODE and
fixes $h_{r, s}$ uniquely. The derivation requires the Kac
determinant formula (Kac 1979) for the Gram matrix of a Verma
module; see Di Francesco–Mathieu–Sénéchal 1997 §7.3 for the full
treatment.

The Kac table has the **reflection symmetry**

$$h_{r, s} \;=\; h_{p - r,\, p' - s},$$

which follows from (2) by substituting $r \to p - r$, $s \to p'
- s$:

$$(p'(p - r) - p(p' - s))^{2}
 = (p'\,p - p'\,r - p\,p' + p\,s)^{2}
 = (p\,s - p'\,r)^{2}
 = (p'\,r - p\,s)^{2},$$

so the numerator of (2) is invariant and $h_{r,s} = h_{p-r, p'-s}$.
This symmetry is the reason the Kac table has roughly half as many
distinct entries as the $(p-1)(p'-1)$ rectangle.

### Step 2 — $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$: the Ising CFT

Substitute $p = 3$, $p' = 4$ into (1):

$$c_{3, 4} \;=\; 1 - \frac{6(4 - 3)^{2}}{3\cdot 4}
 \;=\; 1 - \frac{6}{12} \;=\; \frac{1}{2}.
\tag{3}$$

The central charge $c = 1/2$ is the smallest positive value in the
minimal-model series (the $c_{2, 3}$ model is trivial with only
the identity operator; the next nontrivial case is $\mathcal{M}(3,
4)$). It is also the central charge of a single free Majorana
fermion — not a coincidence, as we discuss at the end.

The Kac rectangle for $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$ has $(p - 1)(p' - 1) =
2 \cdot 3 = 6$ entries labelled by $(r, s)$ with $r \in \{1, 2\}$
and $s \in \{1, 2, 3\}$.

### Step 3 — Kac table for $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$

Compute $h_{r, s}$ for all six $(r, s)$ pairs using (2) with
$p = 3$, $p' = 4$, $p' - p = 1$, $4 p p' = 48$:

$$h_{r, s} \;=\; \frac{(4 r - 3 s)^{2} - 1}{48}.$$

Enumerate:

| $(r, s)$ | $4r - 3s$ | $(4r - 3s)^{2} - 1$ | $h_{r, s}$ |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| $(1, 1)$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $(1, 2)$ | $-2$ | $3$ | $1/16$ |
| $(1, 3)$ | $-5$ | $24$ | $1/2$ |
| $(2, 1)$ | $5$ | $24$ | $1/2$ |
| $(2, 2)$ | $2$ | $3$ | $1/16$ |
| $(2, 3)$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $0$ |

Apply the Kac-symmetry $h_{r, s} = h_{p - r, p' - s}$:

- $(1, 1) \leftrightarrow (2, 3)$: both $h = 0$. ✓
- $(1, 2) \leftrightarrow (2, 2)$: both $h = 1/16$. ✓
- $(1, 3) \leftrightarrow (2, 1)$: both $h = 1/2$. ✓

So the six entries collapse to **three inequivalent conformal
weights**

$$\boxed{\;h \in \{0,\; 1/16,\; 1/2\}.\;}
\tag{4}$$

Each of these is a self-conjugate primary (for a diagonal CFT like
the Ising model, $(h, \bar h)$ are equal — left = right).
Therefore the 2D Ising CFT has exactly **three scalar primary
operators**, with full scaling dimensions

$$\Delta \in \{0,\ 1/8,\ 1\}.
\tag{5}$$

### Step 4 — Identification with lattice operators

We now identify the three primaries with physical operators on the
Ising lattice. The identification uses the **scaling dimension** of
lattice operators in the critical two-point function:

$$\bigl\langle\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{r})\,\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{0})\bigr\rangle_{T_{c}}
 \;\sim\; |\mathbf{r}|^{-2\Delta_{\mathcal{O}}}.
\tag{6}$$

**Identity $\mathbb{I}$, $\Delta = 0$**: the trivial constant
operator. Its correlator is the vacuum expectation, constant in
$|\mathbf{r}|$.

**Spin $\sigma$, $\Delta = 1/8$**: the continuum limit of the Ising
spin variable $\sigma^{z}_{i}$. The two-point function decays as

$$\langle\sigma^{z}(\mathbf{r})\,\sigma^{z}(\mathbf{0})\rangle_{T_{c}}
 \;\sim\; |\mathbf{r}|^{-2\Delta_{\sigma}}
 \;=\; |\mathbf{r}|^{-1/4}.$$

This matches the $\eta = 1/4$ Fisher exponent of the 2D Ising
model (Fisher 1964; Stanley 1971 §12.4), derivable from the
Toeplitz-determinant analysis of
[`yang-magnetization-toeplitz`](yang-magnetization-toeplitz.md).

**Energy $\varepsilon$, $\Delta = 1$**: the continuum limit of
the bond-energy operator
$\varepsilon_{i} \propto \sigma^{z}_{i}\sigma^{z}_{i+1} -
\langle\sigma^{z}\sigma^{z}\rangle_{c}$ (the connected bond-bond
correlator). Its conformal dimension $1$ reflects the thermal
operator — perturbing by $\varepsilon$ tunes $T$ away from $T_{c}$,
with $T - T_{c} \propto \int d^{2}x\,\varepsilon(x)$. The relation
$\nu = 1/(d - \Delta_{\varepsilon}) = 1/(2 - 1) = 1$ reads off the
correlation-length exponent directly.

The lattice → CFT identifications are

$$\sigma^{z}_{i} \;\xrightarrow[a \to 0]{}\; a^{\Delta_{\sigma}}\,\sigma(\mathbf{r}_{i})
 \;=\; a^{1/8}\,\sigma(\mathbf{r}_{i}),$$

$$\sigma^{z}_{i}\sigma^{z}_{i+1} - \langle\sigma^{z}\sigma^{z}\rangle
 \;\xrightarrow[a \to 0]{}\; a^{\Delta_{\varepsilon}}\,\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}_{i})
 \;=\; a^{1}\,\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}_{i}),$$

where the powers of the lattice spacing $a$ accompany the RG
blocking of each operator under a rescaling $\mathbf{r} \to b\mathbf{r}$.

### Step 5 — Critical exponents from $(\Delta_{\sigma}, \Delta_{\varepsilon})$

All critical exponents of the 2D Ising universality class follow
from the two non-trivial scaling dimensions $\Delta_{\sigma} = 1/8$
and $\Delta_{\varepsilon} = 1$ via standard CFT / scaling
relations (Cardy 1996 Ch. 3).

**Fisher exponent $\eta$** (anomalous dimension of the order
parameter). Definition: $\langle\sigma\sigma\rangle \sim
|\mathbf{r}|^{-(d - 2 + \eta)}$. Compare with (6):
$2\Delta_{\sigma} = d - 2 + \eta$, hence

$$\eta \;=\; 2\Delta_{\sigma} - d + 2
 \;=\; 2\cdot\tfrac{1}{8} - 2 + 2 \;=\; \tfrac{1}{4}.$$

**Correlation-length exponent $\nu$.** Definition: $\xi \sim
|T - T_{c}|^{-\nu}$. Scaling dimension of the thermal coupling
$\delta K = \beta(T - T_{c})/J$ is $d - \Delta_{\varepsilon}$
(since $\int d^{2}x\,\varepsilon$ must be dimensionless). Hence

$$\nu \;=\; \frac{1}{d - \Delta_{\varepsilon}}
 \;=\; \frac{1}{2 - 1} \;=\; 1.$$

**Order-parameter exponent $\beta$.** Definition: $M \sim
|T_{c} - T|^{\beta}$. Scaling of $M$ as $\xi^{-\Delta_{\sigma}}$
gives $M \sim \xi^{-\Delta_{\sigma}} \sim |T_{c} - T|^{\nu\Delta_{\sigma}}$,
hence

$$\beta \;=\; \nu\,\Delta_{\sigma} \;=\; 1\cdot\tfrac{1}{8} \;=\; \tfrac{1}{8}.$$

Cross-check with
[`yang-magnetization-toeplitz`](yang-magnetization-toeplitz.md) Step
7, which obtains $\beta = 1/8$ from the Szegő-theorem evaluation
of the Toeplitz determinant: both derivations agree to first
principles.

**Susceptibility exponent $\gamma$.** From Widom scaling $\gamma =
\nu(2 - \eta) = 1 \cdot (2 - 1/4) = 7/4$. Or directly:
the susceptibility scales as $\int d^{2}x\,\langle\sigma\sigma\rangle$
which diverges as $\xi^{d - 2\Delta_{\sigma}}$, giving
$\chi \sim |T - T_{c}|^{-\nu(d - 2\Delta_{\sigma})} = |T -
T_{c}|^{-7/4}$.

**Specific-heat exponent $\alpha$.** Josephson scaling $\alpha = 2
- \nu d = 2 - 2 = 0$, i.e. $\alpha = 0$ with a logarithmic
divergence (Onsager 1944). This matches the exact 2D Ising specific
heat $C \sim |\ln|T - T_{c}||$.

**Critical isotherm $\delta$.** Widom relation $\delta = (d + 2
- \eta)/(d - 2 + \eta) = (4 - 1/4)/(0 + 1/4) = (15/4)/(1/4) = 15$.

Summary of the five independent 2D Ising exponents — all derived
from the Kac table (2) + scaling relations:

| Exponent | CFT formula | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| $\eta$ | $2\Delta_{\sigma} - d + 2$ | $1/4$ |
| $\nu$ | $1/(d - \Delta_{\varepsilon})$ | $1$ |
| $\beta$ | $\nu\,\Delta_{\sigma}$ | $1/8$ |
| $\gamma$ | $\nu(2 - \eta) = \nu(d - 2\Delta_{\sigma})$ | $7/4$ |
| $\alpha$ | $2 - \nu d$ | $0$ (log) |
| $\delta$ | $(d + 2 - \eta)/(d - 2 + \eta)$ | $15$ |

stored values are in

### Step 6 — Why $c = 1/2$? The free-Majorana-fermion
construction

The central charge $c = 1/2$ is also that of a single free Majorana
fermion ($c = N/2$ for $N$ real Majoranas; a complex Dirac fermion
has $c = 1$). This is not a coincidence: the 2D Ising CFT **is**
a free Majorana fermion, via the Jordan–Wigner transformation of
the lattice TFIM at the critical point $h = J$.

From [`jw-tfim-bdg`](jw-tfim-bdg.md) Step 7(iii), the
thermodynamic-limit dispersion of the TFIM at $h = J$ is
$\Lambda(k) = 4 J\,|\sin(k/2)|$, vanishing linearly at $k = 0$
(and $k = 2\pi$). Linearising near $k = 0$ gives two chiral modes
$\Psi_{R}(x), \Psi_{L}(x)$ forming a single Majorana fermion
doublet. The CFT of the long-wavelength theory is therefore a
*single* free Majorana — central charge $c = 1/2$. The three
primaries $\mathbb{I}, \sigma, \varepsilon$ correspond to the
identity, the **disorder operator** (non-local in fermion
language, local in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-dual Ising formulation),
and the **fermion bilinear** $\bar\psi\psi$ (= $\sigma^{z}\sigma^{z}$
after JW) respectively.

The spin–disorder duality between the $\sigma$ and the dual-theory
spin is the CFT avatar of Kramers–Wannier duality; see
[`kramers-wannier-duality`](kramers-wannier-duality.md).

### Step 7 — Limiting-case and consistency checks

**(i) Identity operator.** $\Delta_{\mathbb{I}} = 0$ as required of
any CFT: $\langle\mathbb{I}\rangle = 1$ is constant in $\mathbf{r}$.

**(ii) Unitarity of $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$.** The FQS theorem
(Friedan–Qiu–Shenker 1984) classifies unitary minimal models as
those with $p' = p + 1$; checking $\mathcal{M}(3, 4)$ has
$p' - p = 1$, so it is unitary. The three primaries have
non-negative conformal weights (0, 1/16, 1/2), consistent.

**(iii) Numerical verification against finite-size ED.**
$\sigma$-type operator: the two-point function of $\sigma^{z}$ on
the critical TFIM decays as $|\mathbf{r}|^{-1/4}$; the exponent is
extracted from QAtlas's closed-form correlator in the
`"criticality: scaling toward CFT exponent -1/4"` testset of
`test/models/test_TFIM_dynamics.jl`, which asserts the effective
doubling-ratio slope at $N \in \{80, 160, 240\}$ converges
monotonically to $-1/4$ within $0.10$ at the largest $N$.
The central charge $c = 1/2$ itself is extracted to $\lesssim 1\%$
from the PBC entanglement entropy in
`test/verification/test_entanglement_central_charge.jl`.

**(iv) Yang-magnetisation exponent $\beta = 1/8$.** Derived
independently from the Toeplitz determinant in
[`yang-magnetization-toeplitz`](yang-magnetization-toeplitz.md).
Both derivations yield $\beta = 1/8$ — the microscopic confirmation
of the CFT prediction $\beta = \nu\,\Delta_{\sigma} = 1 \cdot
\tfrac{1}{8}$.

**(v) Logarithmic specific heat.** Onsager 1944 exactly solved the
2D Ising free energy and found $C \sim -\ln|T - T_{c}|$ near
criticality. The CFT value $\alpha = 0$ corresponds to this
logarithmic (not power-law) divergence; the $\alpha = 0$ value is
"degenerate" with a $\ln$ correction, a common feature of
2D CFTs.
