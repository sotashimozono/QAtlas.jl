# Calabrese–Cardy Entanglement Entropy: OBC vs PBC Prefactor

## Main result

For a $1+1$-dimensional critical lattice system described at low
energies by a conformal field theory of central charge $c$, on a
chain of $N$ sites with UV lattice cutoff $a$, the von Neumann
entropy of a single contiguous block of $\ell$ sites takes the
following universal form in the two standard boundary conditions:

$$\boxed{\;
S_{\rm PBC}(\ell, N)
 \;=\; \frac{c}{3}\,\ln\!\left[\frac{N}{\pi a}
          \,\sin\!\left(\frac{\pi\ell}{N}\right)\right]
 \;+\; s_{1},
\;}$$

$$\boxed{\;
S_{\rm OBC}(\ell, N)
 \;=\; \frac{c}{6}\,\ln\!\left[\frac{2 N}{\pi a}
          \,\sin\!\left(\frac{\pi\ell}{N}\right)\right]
 \;+\; s_{1}^{\,\prime}.
\;}$$

The universal logarithmic prefactors differ by exactly a factor of
two — $c/3$ vs $c/6$ — because PBC produces **two** entanglement
cuts (one at each boundary of the block, since the chain is a ring)
whereas OBC produces **one** (the second boundary coincides with a
physical chain end where the environment is already empty). The
additive constants $s_{1}, s_{1}^{\,\prime}$ are model-dependent
and *not* universal.

These two formulas are used throughout QAtlas's verification
pipeline to extract the central charge from finite-size
entanglement-entropy data. See

## Setup

### Continuum setting

Consider a 1+1-dimensional CFT of central charge $c$ on a spatial
manifold $\mathcal{M}$, either:

- **PBC**: a spatial circle of circumference $L = N\,a$, so
  $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}_t \times S^{1}_{L}$. The Euclidean
  spacetime is an infinite cylinder of circumference $L$.
- **OBC**: a spatial segment $[0, L]$, so $\mathcal{M} =
  \mathbb{R}_t \times [0, L]$. The Euclidean spacetime is an
  infinite strip of width $L$.

Let $A = [0, \ell\,a]$ be a contiguous block of $\ell$ sites (in the
lattice picture) or length $\ell_{\rm cont} = \ell\,a$ (in the
continuum); the complement $B$ is the rest of the chain. The
reduced density matrix of $A$ at zero temperature is

$$\rho_{A} \;=\; \mathrm{Tr}_{B}\,|0\rangle\langle 0|,$$

and the von Neumann entropy is $S_{A} = -\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}\ln
\rho_{A}$.

### Goal

Compute $S_{A}$ via the replica trick, the twist-operator
formalism, and the conformal maps from $\mathcal{M}$ to a
computable Euclidean geometry (plane or half-plane). Read off the
logarithmic scaling law and verify the $c/3$ vs $c/6$ prefactor.

## Calculation

### Step 1 — Replica trick

For any positive integer $n$, let $\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}$ be
the *$n$-th Rényi trace* of the reduced state. The **replica
identity**

$$S_{A} \;=\; -\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}\ln\rho_{A}
 \;=\; -\,\lim_{n\to 1}\partial_{n}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}
\tag{1}$$

reduces the computation of the entropy to the computation of a
one-parameter family of traces. The proof is immediate: write
$\rho_{A} = \sum_{k} p_{k}|k\rangle\langle k|$ in its eigenbasis so
$\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n} = \sum_{k} p_{k}^{n}$, differentiate
$\partial_{n}\sum_{k} p_{k}^{n} = \sum_{k} p_{k}^{n}\ln p_{k}$, and
take $n \to 1$ to get $\sum_{k} p_{k}\ln p_{k} = -S_{A}$.

The strategy is now (i) compute $\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}$ for
integer $n \ge 2$ by a path-integral construction, (ii) analytically
continue in $n$, and (iii) apply (1) to extract $S_{A}$.

### Step 2 — Twist-operator construction for $\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}$

The path-integral representation of $\rho_{A}$ is a piecewise
computation: it is the Euclidean path integral on the $\mathcal{M}
\times \mathbb{R}_{\tau}$ spacetime with:

1. a cut along $A$ at imaginary time $\tau = 0^{-}$ (open below),
2. a cut along $A$ at $\tau = 0^{+}$ (open above),

the two sides of each cut being identified cyclically in the
standard partition-function-like Euclidean setup. Taking $n$ copies
and gluing the cuts **cyclically** from one copy to the next
(copy $1$'s upper cut $\to$ copy $2$'s lower cut $\to \dots \to$
copy $n$'s lower cut $\to$ copy $1$'s upper cut) produces an
**$n$-sheeted Riemann surface** branched along the boundary of $A$.
Its partition function is $\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}$.

Cardy–Calabrese 2004 (building on Dixon et al. 1987 and
Knizhnik 1987) show that the $n$-sheeted partition function can be
rewritten as a **correlator of branch-point twist operators**
$\mathcal{T}_{n}$ inserted at the endpoints of $A$, in the
CFT on a single sheet ($\mathcal{M}$, not the $n$-sheeted cover):

$$\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}
 \;=\; \bigl\langle \mathcal{T}_{n}(u)\,\overline{\mathcal{T}}_{n}(v)
        \bigr\rangle_{\mathcal{M}},
\tag{2}$$

with $u = 0, v = \ell$ the endpoints of $A$ and $\mathcal{T}_{n},
\overline{\mathcal{T}}_{n}$ a twist / anti-twist pair. The twist
operator has conformal scaling dimension (Calabrese–Cardy 2004
eq. (1.4))

$$\boxed{\;
\Delta_{n} \;=\; \overline{\Delta}_{n}
 \;=\; \frac{c}{24}\Bigl(n - \frac{1}{n}\Bigr).
\;}
\tag{3}$$

This is the *universal* piece of the result: (3) depends only on
$c$ and $n$, not on any lattice details. Its proof in the
Calabrese–Cardy paper uses the conformal anomaly of the
$n$-sheeted cover; we accept (3) as input here and focus on the
geometry-dependent factor.

### Step 3 — PBC: cylinder geometry, 2-point function of twists

**Step 3a: plane → cylinder.** PBC spacetime is an infinite
cylinder of circumference $L = N a$. The conformal map
$w \mapsto z = e^{2\pi w / L}$ takes the cylinder (coordinates
$w = x + i\tau$) to the plane (coordinates $z$), opening up the
periodic spatial direction into the radial direction on $\mathbb{C}$.

Under this map, a primary operator $\phi$ of dimension $(\Delta,
\overline{\Delta})$ transforms with the Jacobian

$$\phi_{\rm plane}(z) = \left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^{\Delta}
                       \left(\frac{d\overline{w}}{d\overline{z}}\right)^{\overline{\Delta}}
                       \phi_{\rm cyl}(w)$$

(standard primary transformation under conformal maps).

**Step 3b: 2-point function on the plane.** In the plane,

$$\bigl\langle\mathcal{T}_{n}(z_{1})\overline{\mathcal{T}}_{n}(z_{2})\bigr\rangle_{\rm plane}
 \;=\; \frac{C_{n}}{|z_{1} - z_{2}|^{4\Delta_{n}}},$$

with $C_{n}$ a non-universal normalisation that becomes the
$s_{1}$ below.

**Step 3c: pull back to the cylinder.** With twist insertions at
spatial points $x_{1}, x_{2}$ on the $\tau = 0$ spatial slice of
the cylinder, $w_{j} = x_{j}$ and $z_{j} = e^{2\pi x_{j}/L}$.

$$|z_{1} - z_{2}|^{2}
 = (e^{2\pi x_{1}/L} - e^{2\pi x_{2}/L})
   (\overline{e^{2\pi x_{1}/L}} - \overline{e^{2\pi x_{2}/L}}).$$

Using $z - z' = e^{(\theta + \theta')/2}(e^{(\theta - \theta')/2}
- e^{-(\theta - \theta')/2}) = 2 e^{(\theta + \theta')/2}
\sinh((\theta - \theta')/2)$ with $\theta = 2\pi x/L$, this gives

$$|z_{1} - z_{2}|^{2}
 = 4 e^{2\pi(x_{1} + x_{2})/L}\,\sinh^{2}\!\bigl[\pi(x_{1} - x_{2})/L\bigr].$$

Since $x_{j}$ are real, $\sinh[\pi(x_{1} - x_{2})/L]$ is real, and
for $x_{1} - x_{2} = \ell$ (the block extent) the *spatial* distance
reduces to $\sinh(\pi\ell/L)$ — but on the circular cylinder the
spatial distance between the two twist insertions is actually
$\ell$ (straight-line along the cylinder) measured against a
periodic direction. The Euclidean computation here works with the
**chordal** distance on the plane; the final answer is expressed
in terms of the sine of the angular separation $2\pi\ell/L$.

Substituting into the 2-point function and applying the conformal
Jacobians,

$$\bigl\langle\mathcal{T}_{n}\overline{\mathcal{T}}_{n}\bigr\rangle_{\rm cyl}
 \;=\; \frac{C_{n}}{\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\,\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr]^{4\Delta_{n}}}.
\tag{4}$$

(See Calabrese–Cardy 2004 eq. (2.9) and (2.13) for the step-by-step
Jacobian accounting that converts the $\sinh$-expression to a
$\sin$-expression after Wick rotation back to the Lorentzian
cylinder.)

**Step 3d: extract $S_{A}$.** Taking the log and then the
$n \to 1$ derivative per (1):

$$\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}
 = \frac{C_{n}}{\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr]^{4\Delta_{n}}},$$

$$\ln\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}
 = \ln C_{n} - 4\Delta_{n}\ln\!\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr].$$

Substitute $\Delta_{n} = (c/24)(n - 1/n)$ and differentiate with
respect to $n$ at $n = 1$:

$$\partial_{n}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}\Big|_{n = 1}
 = \partial_{n}\ln C_{n}\Big|_{n = 1}
   - 4\cdot\frac{c}{24}\Bigl(1 + \frac{1}{n^{2}}\Bigr)\Big|_{n = 1}\cdot
     \ln\!\bigl[\dots\bigr]$$
$$= \partial_{n}\ln C_{n}\big|_{n = 1}
   - \frac{c}{3}\,\ln\!\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr].$$

Applying (1) $S_{A} = -\lim_{n \to 1}\partial_{n}\mathrm{Tr}\rho_{A}^{n}$,

$$S_{\rm PBC} = \frac{c}{3}\,\ln\!\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr]
              + s_{1},
\tag{5}$$

with $s_{1} = -\partial_{n}\ln C_{n}|_{n = 1}$ a non-universal
constant.

**Converting to lattice units.** With $L = N a$ and $\ell_{\rm cont}
= \ell a$, the argument inside the log is

$$(2 L / \pi)\sin(\pi\ell_{\rm cont}/L)
 = (2 N a/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/N).$$

Absorbing the overall factor of $2$ into $s_{1}$ and combining the
explicit $a$-factor with the $1/a$-factor that sits in the universal
twist-operator normalisation (a UV renormalisation that is
conventionally absorbed into the non-universal constant), we obtain
the boxed PBC Main-result form

$$S_{\rm PBC}(\ell, N)
 = \frac{c}{3}\,\ln\!\left[\frac{N}{\pi a}\sin\!\left(\frac{\pi\ell}{N}\right)\right]
 + s_{1}.$$

### Step 4 — OBC: strip geometry, 1-point function near the boundary

**Step 4a: half-plane → strip.** OBC spacetime is an infinite
strip of width $L = N a$ with two boundaries at $x = 0$ and
$x = L$. The conformal map $w \mapsto z = \sin(\pi w/L)$ takes the
strip (coordinates $w$) to the upper half-plane $\mathrm{Im}(z) \ge
0$, sending the two boundary lines $x = 0$ and $x = L$ to the
real axis.

Under this map, the strip's spatial point $x$ at $\tau = 0$ maps to
$z = \sin(\pi x/L) \in \mathbb{R}$. In particular, the block
$A = [0, \ell]$ in the strip maps to the segment $[0,
\sin(\pi\ell/L)]$ on the positive real axis.

**Step 4b: method of images.** On the upper half-plane with a
**free / Dirichlet boundary** on the real axis (the standard BCFT
for a conformal boundary condition), a primary $\phi(z)$ at
$z \in \mathrm{UHP}$ feels its mirror image $\phi(\bar z)$ at the
reflected point $\bar z \in \mathrm{LHP}$. A single-twist
insertion in the bulk becomes *effectively* a correlator with its
image: the 1-point function in the BCFT is

$$\bigl\langle\mathcal{T}_{n}(z)\bigr\rangle_{\rm UHP}
 \;=\; \frac{A_{n}}{(2\,\mathrm{Im}\,z)^{2\Delta_{n}}},$$

where $A_{n}$ is a boundary-condition-dependent constant (the
boundary-operator coefficient) and the denominator $(2\mathrm{Im}\,
z)^{2\Delta_{n}} = |z - \bar z|^{2\Delta_{n}}$ is exactly the
image-pair distance.

**Step 4c: OBC twist correlator.** Crucially, in the OBC setup
there is *only one* bulk twist insertion (at the single interior
boundary of $A$, since the other boundary of $A$ is the physical
chain end at $x = 0$, which is not an entanglement cut). Applying
the conformal map $z = \sin(\pi x/L)$ with $x = \ell$:

$$|z - \bar z|_{\rm OBC}
 = |\,2 i\,\mathrm{Im}\,\sin(\pi\ell/L)\,|
 = 2\,|\sin(\pi\ell/L)|,$$

wait — for real $x$, $z = \sin(\pi x/L)$ is real, so
$\mathrm{Im}\,z = 0$. The correct interpretation is that on the
$\tau = 0$ slice, the twist insertion sits **on** the real axis of
the half-plane (it is on the boundary of $A$, which in the
spacetime picture at $\tau = 0$ is on the boundary of the strip
equivalently). The image-pair distance must be computed more
carefully using the conformal-transformation Jacobian.

**Step 4d: Jacobian-accounted computation.** Following
Calabrese–Cardy 2004 eq. (19), the result of carrying out the
half-plane image construction and pulling back to the strip is

$$\bigl\langle\mathcal{T}_{n}(x)\bigr\rangle_{\rm strip}
 \;=\; \frac{A_{n}}{\bigl[(2L/\pi)\sin(\pi x/L)\bigr]^{2\Delta_{n}}}.
\tag{6}$$

The key differences from the PBC 2-point function (4) are:

- The **exponent** is $2\Delta_{n}$ (for one operator) instead of
  $4\Delta_{n}$ (for two) — a factor of $2$ saved.
- The **prefactor** inside the log-argument has an extra factor
  of $2$ compared to the PBC result ($(2L/\pi)$ instead of
  $(L/\pi)$), which reflects the method of images — the effective
  distance is measured from the bulk insertion to its image across
  the boundary, which is twice the bulk-to-boundary distance. In
  the lattice-unit version this becomes $2N$ inside the log.

**Step 4e: extract $S_{A}$.**

$$\ln\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}
 = \ln A_{n} - 2\Delta_{n}\ln\!\bigl[(2 L / \pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr].$$

Differentiating in $n$ at $n = 1$:

$$\partial_{n}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho_{A}^{n}\Big|_{n = 1}
 = \partial_{n}\ln A_{n}\big|_{n = 1}
  - 2\cdot\frac{c}{24}\Bigl(1 + \frac{1}{n^{2}}\Bigr)\Big|_{n = 1}\cdot\ln[\dots]$$
$$= \partial_{n}\ln A_{n}\big|_{n = 1}
  - \frac{c}{6}\,\ln\!\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr].$$

Applying (1),

$$S_{\rm OBC}
 = \frac{c}{6}\,\ln\!\bigl[(2 L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)\bigr] + s_{1}^{\,\prime}.
\tag{7}$$

In lattice units $L = N a$, $\ell_{\rm cont} = \ell a$:

$$S_{\rm OBC}(\ell, N) = \frac{c}{6}\,\ln\!\left[\frac{2 N}{\pi a}
  \,\sin\!\left(\frac{\pi\ell}{N}\right)\right] + s_{1}^{\,\prime}.$$

This matches the Main-result boxed OBC form.

### Step 5 — Structural origin of the $c/3$ vs $c/6$ prefactor

Direct contribution counting:

| Feature              | PBC                       | OBC                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Spatial manifold     | ring (circumference $L$)  | segment (width $L$)     |
| Euclidean spacetime  | infinite cylinder         | infinite strip          |
| Conformal map        | cylinder $\to$ plane      | strip $\to$ half-plane  |
| Number of entanglement cuts | $\mathbf{2}$       | $\mathbf{1}$            |
| Twist insertions     | 2-point function          | 1-point function        |
| Log-prefactor exponent | $4\Delta_{n}$           | $2\Delta_{n}$           |
| $n \to 1$ factor     | $c/3$                     | $c/6$                   |
| Inner-argument factor in log | $(L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)$ | $(2L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)$ |

The **factor-of-2 ratio** of the log-prefactors $(c/3)/(c/6) = 2$
tracks exactly the ratio of entanglement cuts $2/1$. Each cut
contributes $c/6$ to the log coefficient; PBC has two cuts, OBC
has one, and the additional factor of $2$ inside the log argument
in the OBC case is the image-doubling of the effective distance.

### Step 6 — Limiting-case and numerical checks

**(i) $\ell \to N/2$ (balanced bipartition).** At the midpoint,
$\sin(\pi/2) = 1$ and the formulas simplify to

$$S_{\rm PBC}(N/2, N) = \frac{c}{3}\ln(N/(\pi a)) + s_{1},$$

$$S_{\rm OBC}(N/2, N) = \frac{c}{6}\ln(2 N/(\pi a)) + s_{1}^{\,\prime}.$$

Both scale as $\ln N$ with coefficients differing by a factor of
two.

**(ii) $\ell \to 0, N$ (endpoints).** $\sin(\pi\ell/N) \to 0$,
both entropies diverge logarithmically — the UV cutoff renders
the entropy finite, and the log-divergence is the usual "area law
with a log correction in 1+1D".

**(iii) Ising TFIM ($c = 1/2$) at OBC.** QAtlas runs the Peschel
correlation-matrix method in
`src/models/quantum/TFIM/TFIM_entanglement.jl`
at $N = 100$ to fit (7) and extract $c \approx 0.5$ within 5%;
see `test/models/test_TFIM_entanglement.jl`
(the "Calabrese–Cardy log scaling" testset).  The Peschel-based
OBC extraction is vastly cheaper than full ED and is one of the
stringent checks of the entanglement-entropy implementation.

**(iv) Heisenberg ($c = 1$) at OBC.** At the Heisenberg-chain
critical point,
`test/verification/test_entanglement_central_charge.jl`
extracts $c \approx 1$ within $20\%$ at $N = 12$, and much better
at larger $N$. The $c = 1$ identification is also consistent with
the independent derivation from the XXZ Luttinger parameter
$K = 1/2$ (see
[`xxz-luttinger-parameters`](xxz-luttinger-parameters.md) Step 7)
— every $c = 1$ compactified-boson CFT gives $c = 1$ regardless of
the compactification radius.

## Why $\Delta_{n} = (c/24)(n - 1/n)$?

The scaling dimension of the branch-point twist operator is the one
piece of input we took for granted in Step 2. Its derivation uses
the conformal anomaly (Weyl transformation) of the $n$-sheeted
cover:

Consider the plane with $n$-fold branching at the twist insertions.
The metric on the $n$-sheeted cover differs from the plane by a
conformal factor, and the partition function acquires a Liouville
action proportional to the central charge $c$. Explicit integration
of the Liouville action over the branched geometry yields an
effective dimension
$\Delta_{n} = (c/24)(n - 1/n)$ for each twist insertion
(Cardy–Calabrese 2004 §2, Holzhey–Larsen–Wilczek 1994). At $n =
1$ the cover is the plane and $\Delta_{1} = 0$; the first-order
Taylor coefficient is $(c/24)\cdot 2 = c/12$, which combines with
the $2$-point-function exponent $4\Delta_{n}$ to give the $c/3$
PBC prefactor.
