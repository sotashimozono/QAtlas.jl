# Triangular Lattice

## Overview

The nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on the triangular lattice
is the simplest frustrated lattice hopping problem. Each site has 6
nearest neighbours, the lattice has a single sublattice per unit cell,
and the resulting single band exhibits a characteristic asymmetric
dispersion that is the hallmark of geometric frustration.

$$H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \bigl(c^\dagger_i c_j + c^\dagger_j c_i\bigr)$$

**Lattice properties**: 1 sublattice per unit cell, 6 nearest
neighbours, **not bipartite** (frustrated), no flat band.

**Key physics**: Because the triangular lattice is non-bipartite, there
is no chiral (particle-hole) symmetry, and the spectrum is **not**
symmetric about $E = 0$. The band ranges from $-6t$ (at $\Gamma$) to
$+3t$ (at the $K$-points), an asymmetric window that is a direct
consequence of frustration. The density of states exhibits a Van Hove
singularity within the band.

## Bloch Spectrum

### Statement

Since the triangular lattice has one sublattice, the Bloch
"Hamiltonian" is a scalar at each $\mathbf{k}$-point:

$$E_{mn} = -2t\left[\cos\theta_1 + \cos\theta_2 + \cos(\theta_2 - \theta_1)\right]$$

where $\theta_1 = 2\pi m/L_x$ and $\theta_2 = 2\pi n/L_y$, with
$\mathbf{a}_1 = (1, 0)$, $\mathbf{a}_2 = (1/2, \sqrt{3}/2)$ the
primitive vectors of `Lattice2D`'s triangular topology.

The full spectrum has $L_x L_y$ eigenvalues, one per allowed momentum.

### Band edges

| Point | $(m/L_x, n/L_y)$ | Energy |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| $\Gamma$ | $(0, 0)$ | $-6t$ (global minimum, unique) |
| $K$ | $(1/3, 2/3)$ | $+3t$ (global maximum) |
| $K'$ | $(2/3, 1/3)$ | $+3t$ (global maximum) |

The band range $[-6t, +3t]$ has total width $9t$, compared to
$[-4t, +4t]$ (width $8t$) for the square lattice. The asymmetry
$|E_{\min}| = 6t \neq |E_{\max}| = 3t$ is a direct manifestation
of the absence of bipartite symmetry.

### Van Hove singularity

At certain energies within the band, the density of states
$g(E) = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \delta(E - E(\mathbf{k}))$ diverges
logarithmically due to saddle points in the dispersion $E(\mathbf{k})$.
These Van Hove singularities are responsible for electronic
instabilities (magnetism, superconductivity) in triangular-lattice
materials.

### K-point commensurability

The $K$-point eigenvalue $E = +3t$ appears in the finite-size spectrum
only when both $L_x$ and $L_y$ are divisible by 3, since the
$K$-point momenta $(1/3, 2/3)$ and $(2/3, 1/3)$ must be commensurate
with the discrete Brillouin zone grid. When this condition is met,
exactly 2 eigenvalues sit at $+3t$.

### QAtlas API

```julia
# Sorted single-particle spectrum, 6×6 triangular PBC
λ = QAtlas.fetch(QAtlas.Triangular(), TightBindingSpectrum(); Lx=6, Ly=6, t=1.0)
# → 36 eigenvalues, ranging from -6.0 to +3.0
```

## Connections

- **Lattice family**: Part of the [tight-binding model catalogue](index.md).
  The triangular lattice is frustrated (non-bipartite) like
  [Kagome](kagome.md), but has only one sublattice and no flat band.
- **Bipartite contrast**: The square lattice (also 1 sublattice) has a
  symmetric band $[-4t, +4t]$ because it is bipartite. The triangular
  band $[-6t, +3t]$ breaks this symmetry.
- **Magnetic frustration**: The non-bipartite structure underlies the
  classical Ising antiferromagnet frustration problem on the triangular
  lattice (Wannier 1950).
- **Methods**: Computed via the
  [Bloch Hamiltonian](../../methods/bloch-hamiltonian/index.md) method.
